break slides with lots of new info into sequences?
go through essay and add points I might forget to presenter notes
tidy up thicker overlapping lines
check haven't missed any graph property items
reduce later commits to one slide?
make graph property slides display the property, then the behaviour on the next slide
run every command and check every output string
line up all misaligned slides precisely
